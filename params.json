{"name":"Ifill","tagline":"A Ruby wrapper for the Compilation of Presidential Documents.","body":"# Ifill: A Ruby wrapper for the Compilation of Presidential Documents\r\n\r\nThe White House releases a lot of stuff, and some of it is included in what's known as the [Compilation of Presidential Documents](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CPD). This is a Ruby library for accessing details about those documents, including subjects, dates, locations and more.\r\n\r\nNearly every day, the White House releases one or more official publications, which may include presidential statements, announcements of nominations, press releases and schedule information. These are published by the Government Printing Office. Ifill wraps JSON endpoints exposed by GPO, which has created a [mobile application](http://m.gpo.gov/dcpd) for browsing and searching these documents. I owe a debt of gratitude to the government employees who made these endpoints available; your commitment to making public information more easily accessible is truly a public service.\r\n\r\nIfill is named for [Gwen Ifill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Ifill), a former New York Times White House correspondent.\r\n\r\nThe current version is 0.7.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'ifill'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install ifill\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    require 'rubygems'\r\n    require 'ifill'\r\n    include Ifill\r\n    \r\n    @latest_docs = Document.latest\r\n    \r\nPlease see [the documentation](http://dwillis.github.com/ifill/) for a more complete description of the library.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nIfill uses minitest and is tested under Ruby 2.1, 2.0 and 1.9.3.; to run the tests:\r\n  \r\n    rake test\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nIfill is licensed under the MIT License.
